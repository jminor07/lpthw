# debugging!

# zed gives us some tips for IF statements:
# 1. Every if must have an else
# 2. if the else should never run because it doesn't make sense then we must use a "die"
# function in the else that prints error message and dies. (I.e. like exit() in ex35.py)
# 3. never nest if statements more than two deep, and try to keep it only 1 deep.
# 4. treat if-statements like paragraphs where each if, else if, and else is like a gropu of sentences.
# put blank lines before and after.
# 5. boolean test should be simple. if complex, move it to variables earlier in the function
# and use a GOOD name for the variable. !


# Tips for LOOPS:
# 1. use a while-loop only to loop forever. (Only in python)
# 2. use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping. Especially if there's a
# fixed number of things to loop over.

# Tips for DEBUGGING:
# 1. Do not use a "debugger".
# 2. The best way to debug a program is to use print() statements to find where variables
# go wrong.
# 3. Make sure parts of your programs run correctly as you work on them.

# logic and how to use it

# we're tasked with making truth tables and memorizing them.
# in python we have these logical operators:
# and
# not
# or
# != (not equal)
# == (equality)
# >= (equal or greater than)
# <= (less than or equal)
# True (integer 1)
# False (integer 0)

# we'll get the hang of them the more we use them.

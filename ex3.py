# numbers and math 

# + plus, - minus , / slash, * asterik, % percent, < less-than, > greater-than, <= less-than-equal, >= greater-than-equal 


print " I will now count my chickens:" # outputs word between quotes to screen

print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6  # we can do math with a comma after the double quotes.
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4 # we can do math with a comma after the double quotes.

print "Now I will count the eggs:"  # outputs word between quotes to screen

print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6  # we can do math with +, -, /, and %. % is the mod operator

print "Is it true that 3 + 2 - 7?"

print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7  # this is pretty neat that we can print a bool value (True/False) with a comparison operator

print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2  # we can do math with a comma after the double quotes.
print "What is 5 -7?", 5 - 7  # we can do math with a comma after the double quotes.

print "Oh, that's why it's False."  # we can print words between double quotes

print "How about some more."  # we can print words between double quotes

print "is it greater?", 5 > -2  # using comparison operator to get bool value.
print "is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2  # using comparison operator to get bool value.
print "is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2  # using comparison operator to get bool value.
